I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. I am advised by [Dr. Necdet Serhat Aybat](https://nsaybat.org/). I also work closely with [Dr. Mert Gürbüzbalaban](https://mert-g.org/). My research interest lies in optimization and its applications in artificial intelligence.
